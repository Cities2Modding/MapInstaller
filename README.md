# MapInstaller

**MapInstaller** is a handy mod for Cities Skylines 2 that simplifies the installation process of custom maps for your game. With this mod, you can easily add new maps to your Cities Skylines 2 experience, whether they are in separate folders or contained within ZIP files. This readme provides all the information you need to get started with MapInstaller.

**Note: MapInstaller is most useful for those who either copy the map into a subfolder within the BepInEx\plugins folder or use a launcher that does this automatically. If you manually download a map, you have the option to install it manually or simply drag it into the folder yourself. MapInstaller provides convenience for those who prefer an automated installation process but is not mandatory for manual installations.**

## Features

- **Automatic Map Installation:** MapInstaller will automatically detect and install custom maps from the `BepInEx\plugins` folder when you launch the game.

- **Flexible Map Locations:** To be detected by MapInstaller, maps should be located within a folder named "Maps" under the `BepInEx\plugins` directory. For example, a map should be in the following structure: `BepInEx\plugins\ExampleMap\Maps\`.

- **ZIP File Support:** MapInstaller can handle ZIP files containing maps. If you have a ZIP file in the `BepInEx\plugins` folder, it will automatically extract the maps from it, as long as the maps are located within a "Maps" folder within the ZIP file.

- **Automatic Updates:** MapInstaller will automatically detect changes and updates. When new versions of maps are deployed, MapInstaller will copy them over to the appropriate directories, ensuring you always have the latest version of your custom maps.
